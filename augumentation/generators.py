def generate_numbers_sequence(digits, spacing_range, image_width):
    """
    Generate an image that contains the sequence of given numbers, spaced
    randomly using an uniform distribution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    digits:
        A list-like containing the numerical values of the digits from which
        the sequence will be generated (for example [3, 5, 0]).
    spacing_range:
        A (minimum, maximum) pair (tuple), representing the min and max spacing
        between digits. Unit should be pixel.
    image_width:
        specifies the width of the image in pixels.

    Returns
    -------
    The image containing the sequence of numbers. Images should be represented
    as floating point 32bits numpy arrays with a scale ranging from 0 (black) to
    1 (white), the first dimension corresponding to the height and the second
    dimension to the width.

    pass

    # Notes
    # training process needs fixed width
    # ideally space between digits would vary with some distribution
    # if all values are max but sum < tot_sum then raise error.
    # if all values are min but sum > tot_sum then raise error
    # min and max have to be more and less than tot_sum/n
